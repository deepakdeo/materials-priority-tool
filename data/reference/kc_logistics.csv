Lithium,8,9,5,"High value-to-weight ratio reduces transport advantage; central location excellent for battery plant distribution"
Cobalt,7,9,4,"Moderate bulk benefit; excellent distribution hub for processed cobalt to Midwest battery plants"
Nickel,8,8,6,"Good bulk transport via rail; existing metal processing infrastructure in region"
Graphite,9,8,5,"Excellent bulk transport benefit; heavy material benefits from rail/barge; growing battery anode demand"
Rare Earths,6,8,3,"Lower bulk benefit (smaller volumes); central location good; limited existing RE processing"
Manganese,9,8,6,"Excellent bulk transport; heavy material; some existing steel/alloy infrastructure applicable"
