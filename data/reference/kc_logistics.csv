material,bulk_transport_benefit,central_location_benefit,existing_infrastructure,kc_notes
Lithium,8,9,5,"High value-to-weight ratio reduces transport advantage; central location excellent for battery plant distribution"
Cobalt,7,9,4,"Moderate bulk benefit; excellent distribution hub for processed cobalt to Midwest battery plants"
Nickel,8,8,6,"Good bulk transport via rail; existing metal processing infrastructure in region"
Graphite,9,8,5,"Excellent bulk transport benefit; heavy material benefits from rail/barge; growing battery anode demand"
Rare Earths,6,8,3,"Lower bulk benefit (smaller volumes); central location good; limited existing RE processing"
Manganese,9,8,6,"Excellent bulk transport; heavy material; some existing steel/alloy infrastructure applicable"
Copper,8,9,7,"Bulk transport advantage; central for grid/EV distribution; existing wire/cable industry"
Platinum Group,5,8,3,"Low volume material; central location good; minimal existing processing"
Gallium,4,7,2,"Very low volumes; semiconductor purity needs; limited KC advantage"
Vanadium,7,8,4,"Moderate bulk benefit; central location good for grid storage; limited current infrastructure"
